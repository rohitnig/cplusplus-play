Purpose    :
	This library is intended for providing C++ Wrapper class
	for native socket api. It is tested under g++(*NIX, Linux, Cygwin),
	Visual C++ Environments, and will support vendor supported C++
	compilers.

Support    :
	Until these release you can use below.

	1. TCP Socket.
	2. UDP Socket.
	3. UNIX Socket (Under *NIX, Linux)
	4. Multiple socket selecting.
	5. Event Handle for socket by WSASelect (Under Win32 VC++)
	   (Naturally, the socket is conterted non-blocking by the function.)
	6. UDP broadcasting function
	7. TCP TIMEWAIT lingering control.
	8. ServerSocket (It supports internally forked child processes)

Tested environment list:
	Solaris 8	(g++ 3.0)
	Solaris 2.5.1	(g++ 2.8.1)
	AIX 4.3 	(g++ 2.9)
	RedHat 7.1	(g++ 2.96)
	Cygwin 1.3.12   (g++ 2.95.3-5)
	Win2000		(Visual Studio.NET 6)

Thank you a lot for using this libray.
